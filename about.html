                      <p>
                        Lets go back in time when I was in 3rd Grade. My interest in the S.T.E.M
                        subjects began to manifest and I found myself deeply invested and quiet frankly just obsessed
                        with
                        trying to
                        figure our how things worked. I'd read any book on any S.T.E.M subjects, but particularly found
                        myself
                        very interested in physics, chemistry and electrical and electronic engineering. My Role Models
                        slowly
                        becoming dead scientists.

                      <p>
                        I'd take apart mine and my little brother's electronic toys making our parents regret buying
                        them in
                        the first place 😆, I'd
                        take apart any electronic
                        device I found around the house, broken or not
                        which got me into quite the pickle with my father. He was never pleased when he found his
                        subwoofers
                        laid out
                        on the floor like scrap metal, I never could figure out how to put them back properlike 😅.
                        But I just loved the entire process of uncovering the mysteries of
                        how these
                        devices worked and I just wanted to learn more.

                      <p>
                        My love for these devices led to my fascination
                        with how they worked. I wanted to understand the magic that brought these inannimate objects to
                        life,
                        especially when it came to consoles and phones that had video games, I wanted to
                        make my own. This was around the same time my obsessions with games and tech
                        grew.
                        Fast forward 2015 my brother started attending school at NACIT (National College of Information
                        and
                        Technology). While
                        there he learned the Magic was called software, and it was made
                        by people, human written instructions called code, that brought them to life.

                        into games
                        and wanted to learn how to make my
                        own, so whenever he got back from school in the evening he let me use his PC. Interestingly, my
                        first language was c#, my first IDE was VS Community.
                        And I started making tutorial based projects like "The Hello world gui projects" that most c#
                        books
                        have. And I was hooked.

                      <h3>A Path Forgotten 🚶🏿‍♂️: 2015/2017</h3>
                      <p>
                        But as puberty hit and highschool crept around the corner I realized quickly that being a nerd
                        came
                        with challenges.
                        Being mocked for liking comics, cartoons, anime and programming or anything that sounded techie.
                        Constantly Being
                        called a <b>geek, nerd, retard, weirdo</b>. If you can name it, I was called it. <br> <br>
                        But I guess you could say I adapted. Started behaving in a way that society might call "cool".
                        Though I never indulged
                        in drugs 🎉, I found myself slacking off, causing trouble at school just to get a few laughs out
                        of
                        my classmates.
                        Some classmates, who by the way, I'm longer in contact with. Life right 🤷🏿‍♂️. <br> <br>
                        I had definitely lost my way though, my grades were slipping and so much time had gone by since
                        I
                        last opened
                        an IDE or read a
                        book that I completely forgot what programming or coding was. And I lost interest in anything
                        that
                        had to
                        do with S.T.E.M.
                        <br>Oh and I failed my highschool exams. But still got into university 😎.

                      <h3>Return of The Prodigal Son 🦸🏿‍♂️: 2017/2018</h3>
                      <p>
                        So, I'd lost my way and was performing really bad academically. And the whole facade of trying
                        to
                        impress people became
                        so boring and I could tell it was useless. I had hit an adolescent life crisis. And as many Gen
                        Z
                        citizens do, I looked towards
                        google and youtube for advice. Not the best idea, but I found myself on articles and videos
                        about
                        embracing who you are, figuring
                        shit out and building a life of happiness and wealth. You know the gist, the self help culture
                        had
                        gotten a hold of me. <br> <br>
                        It wasn't the best advice I would have gotten, but at the time it worked. I looked towards what
                        really made me happy and had
                        found myself drawn back to Science and Tech. I remembered what it was like to have that spark
                        that
                        made me curious about the
                        world. And I needed that feeling back in my life. I started reading books on self help,
                        philosophy
                        and financial literacy. <br> <br>
                        As I continued on this journey, I spent a lot of my time at home, either reading or watching
                        videos
                        on self help and playing
                        video games. I realized I enjoyed this process more than impressing people and seeking their
                        approval. I was ok with having a few
                        friends, being a nerd into tech, a geek into games and comics. And by the time I finished my
                        highschool exams, even though I wasn't
                        confident about my performance on them. I knew exactly what I wanted to do with my life.

                      <p>
                        After highschool, not knowing which university I wanted to go to (Or could afford, cause lets be
                        honest here, I Would have loved
                        attending MIT or Stanford or UC Berkely or Colorado School of Mines or Harvard), my sister got
                        me my
                        first
                        laptop 🥳. <br>
                        And I just loved this thing. A 15 inch' Acer Aspire V5 573g with an Intel I7 4th gen H
                        processor,
                        nVidia Geforce GT720m dedicated graphics card 4gb memory,
                        8gb of memory and an aluminum sleek finish metal chassis. It was a beast to me and best of all,
                        all
                        the
                        available game engines could run on it back then.

                        <li>Unreal engine</li>

                        I decided I'd give programming a second chance. Best decision of my life. I started learning
                        about
                        games with C++ and C#, respectively with the game
                        engines. I was interested in Android app development and Web design and Website development. I
                        wanted
                        to learn it all. And I was willing to dedicate
                        my entire life towards getting to understand how to create software that would be available on
                        billions of devices, being used by billions of people.

                      <h3>So What now 🤔: Going forward</h3>
                      <p>
                        Though I'm back it hasn't been easy. I've suffered heavily from imposter syndrome, about 6 years
                        now. I'm not a child prodigy. I find grasping math concepts somewhat difficult. And if you're
                        into
                        game dev, you know there's quite a
                        bit of math involved in graphics and
                        animation and core game logic design. Don't even get me started on excellent, sexy looking front
                        end
                        design and responsive design.
                        But I'm Constantly learning, trying to figure things out as I go. And that's whats important. I
                        have
                        never been so into anything in my entire life
                        as I'm into tech and computer science. I want to be one of the individuals causing shifts in the
                        world of tech. Improving and helping human kind further its evolution
                        in any way that I can.

                        <b>Friendly advice: </b>The road to figuring out who you are or want to be in life is going to
                        be
                        difficult. People will
                        either not understand you and your intentions or they'll misinterpret your words and demeanor.
                        Add
                        being a
                        <b>Nerd or Weirdo or Socially awkward or Challenged individual</b>
                        on top of that, you get another added layer of difficulty and challenges to overcome. I'm not
                        buying
                        into the stereo
                        typical
                        examples out there but lets be honest for a sec, people who are having
                        trouble with trying to fit into society, most of the times fall into these categories.

                        from novice to pro (I'm still walking the path 😂). It's the journey to pro that you should be
